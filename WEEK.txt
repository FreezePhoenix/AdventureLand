- All the negative conditions are now affected by "stresistance" and sent as a "condition" character event
- There's a new very aggressive male Harpy
- Cuteness adds a negative aggro difference - this way >1 aggro values make some sense too
- Bling adds a positive aggro difference - this way even peaceful monsters could attack you
- New Item: Harpy Bow - along with its own crafting recipe, Harpy's both drop the crafting material and the bow itself, so it's not just low-RNG based and there'll be a slow but steady progress too
