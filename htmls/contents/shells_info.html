		<div class="gamebutton gamebutton-small mr5 mt5 mb5">Where to Find</div>
		<div class="gray"><span style="color: #F4F4F4">&gt;</span> You can get shells by farming green Goo's, from exchangeable items as rare rewards and through various other hidden and non-hidden ways in-game.</div>
		<div class="gamebutton gamebutton-small mr5 mt10 mb5">Original Plan</div>
		<div class="gray"><span style="color: #F4F4F4">&gt;</span> Adventure Land aims to cover operating costs and generate long-term revenue by selling <a href="https://adventure.land/shells" target="_blank">SHELLS</a> as a premium currency. It will be for cosmetic items, possibly extra bank storage and some rare account operations, like character transfers. <span style='color:#D0D0D0'>Keeping the game non-p2w is a top priority</span>, so SHELLS won't affect in-game performance.</div>
		<div class="gamebutton gamebutton-small mr5 mt10 mb5">After Steam Early Access</div>
		<div class="gray"><span style="color: #F4F4F4">&gt;</span> Adventure Land performs really well on Steam so far, as an indie-developer, one of my biggest concerns was being cash positive. If it continues like this, and I hope it does, it might even be possible to introduce cosmetics through in-game achievements and gold only.</div>
