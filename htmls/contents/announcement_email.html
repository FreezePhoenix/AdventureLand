					<p style="color: #E86E2C">Hi Adventurer!</p>
					<p>Wizard here, I develop the game, since the game launched, with your feedback, I've added Partying, Trade, Merchanting, PVP, The Bank, Item Abilities, Class Abilities, New Classes: Priest, Rogue, Ranger, and a lot more that I can't remember right now, so basically, the core dynamics of the game improved significantly.</p>

					<p>Oragon in game, and Jayson in real life, joined the team to build new maps and improve the content of the game, he has been progressing really well, the new TOWN has been ready for weeks, but we are waiting a bit to re-launch the game with new content, anyway, enough talking.</p>

					<p>Onto the subject of this email, the HALLOWEEN ZONE!!!</p>

					<p>Check it out, it has some new halloween themed monsters, unique drops that will become really valuable after the zone closes down, and you can get a lot of candy drops from monsters that you can EXCHANGE for a random reward!</p>

					<p>Anyway, while we work on the game, spend these couple of weeks in the Halloween zone, in November, I'm guessing the new content should be ready. I know you all want more adventure, I will do my best to give you more excitement.</p>

					<p style="color: #E86E2C">Hi Adventurer!</p>
					<p>What's new? We have a new map called Spooky Town, The crafting system has been brewing for some time, make sure to farm some Hawk's ;) Many of the promised and non-launched features will launch before Xmas.</p>

					<p>Be really careful in Spooky Town, unlike our earlier maps and content, Spooky Town can be very hostile!</p>

					<p>Our Halloween inspired event starts today and It will last 3 weeks!</p>

					<p>Note: You can now play with 2 characters in normal servers and one character in a PVP server freely, going to renovate/ease the dynamics even further soon</p>

					<p>Additionally, many players requested access to game's map editor, I decided to add a place called the "Resort" to the game, where players create their own maps for other players to visit, while the Resort is still in development, the public map editor is live! Here's your link: <a style="color: #E86E2C" href="http://adventure.land/map/{{user.k()}}_1"><span style="color: #E86E2C">http://adventure.land/map/{{user.k()}}_1</span></a></p>

				{% elif purpose == "anniversary" %}
					<p style="color: #41AFDE">Hi Adventurer!</p>
					<p>Our Anniversary Event is live! It's a good time to continue playing Adventure Land. Our Anniversary Gifts are global drops. You can start opening (exchanging) the gifts nearing the end of the event.</p>

					<p>As another suggestion, Farm Ice Roamer's, Big Pom Pom's, or Arctic Bee's for "Essence of Frost"'s. It's our first crafting material, pretty soon you will be able to craft new weapons with it. As another thing to look forward to, pretty soon, we are going to launch underground tunnels that will house new monsters/bosses with new drops, these tunnels will connect all of Adventure Land together!</p>

					<p style="color: #E86E2C">Hi Adventurer!</p>
					<p>What's new? We have a new boss called Franky in Mansion - a cooperative boss, no one has defeated him yet!</p>

					<p>There are a lot of small, recent changes, for example a new party system with individual party shares. Phoenix, Mr. Pumpkin, Mr. Green are now cooperative bosses too. So everyone can contribute to taking them down, and get a decent drop!</p>

					<p>We're also getting close to a Steam release.</p>
