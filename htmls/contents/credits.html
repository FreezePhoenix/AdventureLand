<p>First of all, I want to thank all the players who played the game, provided feedback, endured, shared the joyous moments, kept pushing the game in the right direction.</p>
<p>I want to thank /r/mmorpg for being an open platform for mmorpg enthusiasts, I posted on /r/mmorpg at the end of 2016, and I've been improving and shaping the game with the small early adopter userbase ever since.</p>
<p>I want to thank Mark Jayson Lacandula, aka Json, I started working on the game in June 2016, launched very early around August 2016, he was one of the very first players who tried the game after seeing my tiny Adsense Ad. I didn't take him too seriously when he wanted to try my in-house map editor, but shared it with him anyway. After a very short time, he shared the first map he made, at that moment I knew I discovered a rare natural talent. He made all our maps, learned pixel art, extended our tilesets and sprites and kept exploring, he was and is always there, through the good times and the bad times. Game development is no easy task, contrary to popular belief, it's not rewarding, you rarely reap the benefits, up to this point, we didn't reap, but he never quit - so thank you Json. I hope after Adventure Land, you keep on working in the game industry. (Reader: If you are a talent hunter, do reach out to him)</p>
<p>I want to thank Ellian, our freelance pixel artist, for being the most professional freelancer I've ever worked with. No one is more reliable than you. Adventure Land started with an off-the-shelf 16x16 icon pack, with Ellian, we created a custom 20x20 iconset, with the community we dreamed, Ellian made. Workload-wise, Adventure Land is a small-fish, but through 2 years, he was always there at a moment's notice. To extend our iconset 5-6 items at a time :) If I could do it all over again, maybe for Adventure Land 2, I'd love to create all the tilesets and sprites from scratch with Ellian.</p>
<p>I want to thank all the developers, artists, composers, whose libraries, assets and work I used in Adventure Land.</p>
<p>And thank you for reading, and hopefully for playing Adventure Land :)</p>

<p>I want to also thank Steam for being such an awesome platform, 1+ years now, it has been driving new players in, no advertisements or marketing.</p>
<p>Another thanks to Google Cloud for providing us startup credits, it really eased my financial burdens during this development stage.</p>
