<p>There's one non-breakable main rule, you can't upset, bully, or sadden other players - Adventure Land thrives on being a positive game with a positive community. When you treat other players with love and respect, they'll treat you that way too!</p>

<p>The secondary rule is to not abuse the game, you can do pretty much everything with Code, and the game, we are even exploring allowing non-UI botting, but, please don't DDOS the game, or intentionally abuse bugs you find. We have lucrative bug bounties</p>

<p>Third rule is to respect the character limits, maintaining the game is beyond imagination costly, almost non-feasable, If everyone respects the limits, we won't be needing to add irritating captchas etc. to keep playing. While you might easily use a VPN or server to play with additional characters, please don't (It has been done in the past, at 2+ accounts, it usually gets noticed fast, you'll only force me to divert my time and energy into battling multiple accounts, please don't)</p>

<p>Selling items, gold etc. with real money is forbidden, don't waste your money, but maybe buy 1-2 cosmetic items to support the game :)</p>

<p>Offensive or insensitive nicknames are forbidden</p>

<p>Breaking the rules usually result in temporary bans, don't be afraid to try new things, as long as you mean well, there won't be any consequences</p>

<p>Have fun</p>
