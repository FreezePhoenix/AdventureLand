<p>Adventure Land has a feature called Code Messages. It's a server-wide feature. You can't send a CM from EU I to EU II, however, you can send a code message anywhere from EU I to another character in EU I.</p>

<p>You can send objects as CM's, anything that can be JSON.stringify'ed can be sent, larger messages have higher code costs.</p>

<div class='code'>
send_cm("Wizard","hello"); // Send a string
send_cm("Wizard",{"items":character.items}) // Send your inventory data as a CM
send_cm(["Wizard","Protector"],{"task":"move","map":character.map,"x":character.x,"y":character.y})
// you can send CM's to multiple recipients
// Instead of sending code messages individually, send them to multiple recipients whenever possible, the code cost is lower
</div>

<p>To handle incoming CM's:</p>


<div class='code'>
function on_cm(name,data)
{
	if(name!="Wizard") // Make sure to check who the CM came from
	{
		game_log("Unauthorized CM "+name);
		return;
	}
	show_json(data);
}
</div>
