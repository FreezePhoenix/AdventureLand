<p>Adventure Land communicates with it's backend through API calls. This backend system has access to all the servers and characters. While the API system is intended for manual use only, you can use this system to occasionally programatically check out your friends, or check out all the online merchants.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the data format and method names can change at any time in the future without a warning.</p>

<div class='code'>
parent.api_call('pull_merchants');
parent.api_call('pull_friends');
</div>

<p>To catch the response:</p>


<div class='code'>
game.on('api_response',function(data){
	if(data.type=="merchants")
	{
		show_json(data);
	}
});
</div>
