<p>Your characters each have their own code slots, the game client auto saves your code to the game servers each time you run your code after a change.</p>
<p>In addition to character code slots, you have 100 additional code slots, numbered from 1 to 100! Whereas your character code slots have larger numbers like 482008842 - which are actually the ID's of your characters.</p>
<p>You can check out: <span class='jlabel' onclick="code_eval('show_json('+$(this).html()+')')">X.codes</span> - which includes the dictionary of your codes.</p>
<p>The Steam and Mac clients also synchronize a local folder to include all your codes, you can type <span class='hlabel clickable' onclick='say("/codes")'>/codes</span> in chat to open this folder</p>
<p>Your character codes are inside the <span class='dlabel'>characters</span> folder with file names such as <span class='dlabel'>Wizard.482008842.js</span> - Whereas your code slots are in the <span class='dlabel'>codes</span> folder with names such as <span class='dlabel'>Farming.12.js</span> - the number before .js matters a lot - it's how the game determines where to sync the file to.</p>
<p>If you open the game on a different computer and there are old code files, they are moved to the <span class='dlabel'>history</span> folder, when the game detects simultaneous conflicting changes, the file is moved to the <span class='dlabel'>clash</span> folder. The code synchronization system is designed to be self healing and self synchronizing, but from feedback, currently it's not performing too well. If you can isolate a scenario it fails, it will help tremendously!</p>
<p>Useful Functions:</p>
<p><span class='rlabel' onclick="render_function_reference($(this).html())">load_code</span></p>
<p><span class='rlabel' onclick="render_function_reference($(this).html())">require_code</span></p>
<p><span class='rlabel' onclick="render_function_reference($(this).html())">upload_code</span></p>
<p><span class='rlabel' onclick="render_function_reference($(this).html())">get_active_code_slot</span></p>
<p><span class='rlabel' onclick="render_function_reference($(this).html())">get_edited_code_slot</span></p>
<p>Your character loads its default code slot when you open the game in a new place, if you use the character default slot, it will be practical to open the game on Steam/Web etc. - However, you can also make a character use any other code slot locally. It's a good idea to use the character default slots for high level logic, and put your functions and routines to numbered code slots and in your character code slot, load those codes using <span class='rlabel' onclick="render_function_reference($(this).html())">load_code</span> which is pretty similar to just copy/pasting that entire code slot to the place where you load the code.</p>
