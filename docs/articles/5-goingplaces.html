<p>Simplest way to move your character is the move method.</p>

<div class='code'>
move(100,-50); // Takes you to X: 100, Y: -50
</div>

<p>However, as you'll notice, move can't pass obstacles or chart a smart course, this is where smart_move shines.</p>

<div class='code'>
smart_move(100,-50);
smart_move({x:100,y:-50});
smart_move({x:100,y:-50,map:character.map});
// These 3 all take you to X: 100, Y: -50
</div>
