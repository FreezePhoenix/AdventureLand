// Welcome!
// These things are comments, they aren't evaluated as Javascript
/* This is a comment too */
// In this Tutorial, you are going to learn about variables and addition

var a=5; // We defined a - and set it's value to 5

b=6; // We set the value of b to 6 - if b wasn't defined, it's defined now

a=12; // Set set the value of a to 12

c=a+b; // c is now 12+6 - which is 18

b=20; // We set the value of b to 20

game_log(c); // game_log writes whatever you provide into the game's own logs

alert(c); // alert simply alerts whatever you provide it, try to use game_log whenever you can, it's less intrusive
