<p>Items are defined in <span class='jlabel' onclick="code_eval('show_json('+$(this).html()+')')">G.items</span> You can think of each G.items entry as a recipe for an item, the definition of the item. One example:</p>

<div class="code">
"fclaw":{
	"type": "weapon",
	"wtype": "fist",
	"skin": "fclaw",
	"attack": 14,
	"range": 5,
	"ability": "freeze",
	"attr0": 0.2,
	"int": 8,
	"upgrade":{
		"attack": 4,
		"range": 1.5,
		"attr0": 0.1,
	},
	"name": "Frozen Claw",
	"g": 72000,
	"a": True,
	"grades": [0,7],
}
</div>

<p>It's of "type"/"weapon" - It's weapon type, i.e. "wtype" is "fist" - If you check <span class='jlabel' onclick="code_eval('show_json('+$(this).html()+')')">G.classes</span> - You can see which classes use "fist" weapons. The item's visible "name" is "Frozen Claw" - keep in mind that the item's keyname is "fclaw"</p>

<p>"grades" property determines [At what level the item becomes High grade, At what level the item becomes Rare grade], so [0,7] means it's High grade at +0 and Rare grade at +7.</p>

<p>Now that we know about the definition/recipe, we can move onto the actual items/products of these recipes. You can inspect your own items before we do so: <span class='jlabel' onclick="code_eval('show_json('+$(this).html()+')')">character.items</span> One example:</p>

<div class="code">
{
	"name": "fclaw",
	"level": 8,
}
</div>

<p>So actual items refer to their definitions with their "name" attributes. It's the keyname from G.items</p>

<p>Useful function: <span class='rlabel' onclick="render_function_reference($(this).html())">item_grade</span></p>
