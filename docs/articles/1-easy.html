{#<p>Programming Languages are a lot like Microsoft Word, there are a lot of itsy bitsy features, imagine seeing Microsoft Word for the first time, all those functionalities, interfaces that you don't know what to do.. They would intimidate you, right? Yes it would. But anyone can use a text editor, you just type stuff, maybe make it bold, italic, If you are a pro at it, maybe align the text a bit, and that's it! <- Well coding is a lot like that too!</p>

<p>If you are not a coder, all the things that you don't know must be scaring you, scaring you so much that you could be believing that you can't do it. Well, know this: Things you don't know are a lot like the stupid functionalities Microsoft Word has, no normal person is going to use them, you don't need to know them, you can write a masterpiece novel and not know anything about them.</p>#}

<p>Coding is a lot like using a Text Editor, or a Calculator, it's just a tool to help you automate, to make computers do things for you, and in Adventure Land, you can make Code play the game for you :)</p>

<p>The Secret: You don't need to learn everything about a programming language, you just need to learn very little, and the rest, you can Google!</p>
