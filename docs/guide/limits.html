<div class="title mt15">Servers</div> <div class="mb5"></div>

<div>Your character state is shared among all servers. For example when you move from Europas I to Americas II, your character continues from the same location.</div>

<div class="divider"></div>
<div class="title mt15">Character Limits</div> <div class="mb5"></div>

<div>You can have at most 3 characters and 1 merchant online at any time. So you can simultaneously open 3 game windows and play with 3 characters!</div>


<div class="divider"></div>
<div class="title mt15">Code Call Limits</div> <div class="mb5"></div>

<div>Each character has a limited amount of calls it can make to the servers. If you write CODE that exceeds this amount the server will disconnect your character.</div>


<div class="divider"></div>
<div class="title mt15">One Account Per Player</div> <div class="mb5"></div>

<div>You are allowed to have a single account. Each account you create shares the same limits. So even if it's technically possible to create multiple accounts so players have the freedom to make changes and corrections on their own, creating an account for someone else will hinder your own gameplay causing the limits enforcer system to take automatic action. While the game struggles to stay DRM-Free, due to demand, accounts are automatically deactivated if the game is refunded.</div>

<div class="divider"></div>
<div class="title mt15">Playing Together</div> <div class="mb5"></div>

<div>Currently unlimited players can play together from the same network, household, campus. Assuming they all individually purchased the game from Steam or Mac App Store. Thanks to the identity verification these platforms provide, it was possible to bypass the IP limits system that served our game for so long. It doesn't matter whether you play from Steam, Mac or Web. You can choose whatever platform you like. Legacy accounts are still subject to IP limitations.</div>

<div class="divider"></div>
<div class="title mt15">Accounts Need to be Selfish</div> <div class="mb5"></div>

<div>Every account needs to be at least 80% self serving. It's possible to run someone else's account for them, however if the account you run for someone else doesn't mainly serve itself, all the accounts you run will be temporarily banned up to a year.</div>

<div class="divider"></div>
<div class="title mt15">Every Account Needs an Active Personna!</div> <div class="mb5"></div>

<div>Accounts that never interact with the game yet operate 24/7 will be temporarily banned unless their merchants are social and active or the owner interacts with other players on Discord. It's enough to interact once every week on average. This is an anti-leech/multi-account rule, however the game is more fun for everyone this way too.</div>

<div class="divider"></div>
<div class="title mt15">False Positives</div> <div class="mb5"></div>

<div>In case automated systems falsely take action, you can always email hello@adventure.land or message Wizard on Discord!</div>


<div class="divider"></div>
<div class="title mt15">Game Rules</div> <div class="mb5"></div>

<div>We thrive to have a positive community. So bullying, swearing etc. are strictly forbidden. Those who find game bugs are rewarded with Bug Bounty Box'es. Finding bugs, not reporting them / exploiting them is frowned upon.</div>
