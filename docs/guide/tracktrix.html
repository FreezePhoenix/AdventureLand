okay. the panel starts with "each monster kill increases your score by 1.
later it says if you are in a party each kill increases your score by 1.
I would prefer the sentence(given that its correct here) "Each monster your character or your party kills increases the score by 1"
Just for the sake of clraification I also gotta ask: party in this case includes members that are not MY characters right?
I generally think that the word "you" shouldnt be in that text, because "you" are the operator of up to 4 characters. Best use "Your character"
Also there are many statements "IF one of your characters" etc. I think those statements should be converted to either "for each of your character within 600 px range" or "If at least one of your characters is within 600 px range" depending which one of those it actually is, since that is not clear right now

#TODO: Consider combining party/alone

My main reason being that the alone section already makes a mention to party play
If anything make an extra section that specifically adresses merchants

One more thing. 0.3 to 0.25 difference is fairly minor. Consider balancing them inbetween sor simplicitys sake
Whether a nearby character is in your party or not that difference is
