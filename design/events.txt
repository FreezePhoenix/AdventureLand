Mystery House
1) Entry room, small cozy room, just 3 doors, player picks one to enter a random room
2) [Random] Haunted room, there are 2-4 doors, there are 5-8 ghosts inside, this is a ~large room, the player can engage ghosts or just escape, ghosts are extremely aggressive - there might be 1-2 random chests inside the room
3) [Random] Chest room, the player got lucky, he found a chest, there are 2-3 doors to select to exit
4) [Random] Boss room, there is a random boss inside, there are 2-3 doors to escape from
5) [Random] Gateway room, there are 3-7 doors inside, there might or might not be a random chest too
6) Exit room, players luck has ran out, the exit room has just one door, and that teleport the player to the entrance

In (3) and (5), the chests might spawn a super strong boss, it will likely kill the player, so they shouldnâ€™t be super tiny rooms, there should be space for a random spawning vicious monster

The Rush
1) Potion Zone (Monsters drop potions in this room)
2) Scroll Zone (Monsters drop scrolls in this room/area)
3) Item Zone (Monsters/Bosses drop accessories, weapons, armors in this area)
4) Upgrade/Compound Zone - There is one bust or monument, players can upgrade or compound here
Players need potions as the +100/+200 potionless bonuses are +10/+20 in this area, and they can't bring potions inside
Players need scrolls as to leave this zone with anything, the upgraded items need to be at least +8, accessories need to be +2 (or +1, if it's rare, not sure yet)
Players have a total of 15 minutes inside the zone
They could choose to go after the bosses for better drops, or, they could slay normal monsters for worse accessories, weapons, armors etc.
We could divide (3) into 2 zones, bosses and monsters, unsure yet
