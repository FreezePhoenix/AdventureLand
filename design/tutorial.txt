Aid's / UI / Ideas
I) "Move" Moves the player to an ideal point for this tutorial step, uses `smart_move`
II) "Skip" Skips the tutorial step
III) "Dismiss" Dismisses the tutorial altogether
IV) "Awards" - Possibly tie the tutorial to an Achievements system, for example, give away 3 rings at one step, before "COMPOUND"
